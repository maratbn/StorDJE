            <p>
            The Dojo Toolkit, upon which this utility is based, features a versatile
            topic-based event publishing and subscription framework, that allows
            widgets throughout the application to receive notifications of various
            events and associated data.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, as of version 1.5.0, the Dojo Toolkit lacks a utility to also
              allow retrieval of previously published event data, preventing the event
              system from being used to store data for the application model.
            </p>
            <p>
              Such a capability is important for UI components that are created by their
              parent components upon notification of (and obviously after) a particular
              event, but that still periodically require the latest data from that
              particular event topic throughout their lifecycle.
            </p>

            <h4>Overview and purpose:</h4>
            <p>
              This is a storage layer add-on utility for the Dojo Toolkit event system.
              It loads on top of Dojo, and provides additional API for retrieval of
              previously-published topic-based event data, making it possible for
              application components to access event data that could not be received, or
              was not needed, at the time it was originally published.
