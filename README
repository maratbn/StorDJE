Description:

  Background:

    The Dojo Toolkit, upon which this utility is based, features a versatile
    topic-based event publishing and subscription framework, that allows
    widgets throughout the application to receive notifications of various
    events and associated data.

    However, as of version 1.5.0, the Dojo Toolkit lacks a utility to also
    allow retrieval of previously published event data, preventing the event
    system from being used to store data for the application model.

    Such a capability is important for UI components that are created by their
    parent components upon notification of (and obviously after) a particular
    event, but that still periodically require the latest data from that
    particular event topic throughout their lifecycle.

  Overview and purpose:

    This is a storage layer add-on utility for the Dojo Toolkit event system.
    It loads on top of Dojo, and provides additional API for retrieval of
    previously-published topic-based event data, making it possible for
    application components to access event data that could not be received, or
    was not needed, at the time it was originally published.
